# SpatialScan: Computer Vision-based 3D Object Measurement System

## Overview
SpatialScan is an advanced real-time 3D object volume and weight measurement system developed for the Inter IIT Tech-Meet 11.0 in India. The project seamlessly integrates Computer Vision techniques with a dynamic Arduino-based hardware set-up, providing accurate and efficient measurements.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Measurement:** Obtain instant and accurate volume and weight measurements of 3D objects.
- **Computer Vision Integration:** Utilizes advanced OpenCV algorithms for object recognition, segmentation, and measurement.
- **Dynamic Hardware Set-up:** The system incorporates a dynamic Arduino-based hardware configuration to adapt to different object shapes and sizes.
- **Efficient Frame Rate:** Achieved an efficient average frame rate of 30 frames per second for webcam frame processing.
- **Load Cell and Ultrasonic Sensor Integration:** Utilizes a load cell with an HX711 module for weight measurement and an ultrasonic sensor for height measurement.
- **Custom Pixel-Height Relationship:** Implemented a custom Pixel-Height relationship derived from a Regression model to compute the volume of various regular-shaped objects accurately.

## Project Components
- **Computer Vision Module:** The core of the system responsible for object recognition and segmentation is OpenCV.
- **Arduino-based Hardware Set-up:** Dynamic hardware configuration including sensors (load cell, ultrasonic) and actuators for precise measurements.
- **User Interface:** An interactive interface for users to initiate measurements and view results in real-time.
